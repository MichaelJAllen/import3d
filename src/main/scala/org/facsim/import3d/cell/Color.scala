/**
Base trait for all ''AutoMod cell'' file colors.

Prior to release 12.6, ''AutoMod's cell'' file format supported 16 colors (with corresponding names in ''AutoMod'' code)
represented by integers in the range 0-15. Release 12.6 added a further 64 colors (also with corresponding names in
''AutoMod'' code), represented by integers in the range 16-79.

@todo Technically, each color's ''red, green and blue'' (''RGB'') components can be specified by the user, in a file
named `.asilibrc` in the same directory as an ''AutoMod'' model or ''cell'' file. At some point in the future, these
customized colors will be supported; however, for now, the RGB components of each color matches the default RGB
component values for each ''cell'' color.

now regarded as the standard colors. ''AutoMod'' release 12.6 added a further 64 colors (codes 16-79), which are now
referred to as the extended colors.
